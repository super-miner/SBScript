# SBScript Design Specifications

SBScript (SBS) aims to create a language that compiles to highly efficient Scratch (`.sb3`) projects, while remaining decoupled from the underlying structure of Scratch. This is as opposed to other languages, which try to emulate the structure of Scratch projects in text (see [goboscript](https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript)). The language will have a similar syntax and feature set to modern programming languages such as C# and Swift with minimal sacrifices to convinience and ease of use. As a result, SBS will lose some performance by implementing features not found natively in Scratch and the produced Scratch projects may be less readable, but this is deemed worth it in exchange for these conviniences.

## Scratch 3's Limitations

Before discussing the design of SBS it is important to define some of Scratch's limitations. In case these limitations are changed in the future, their values will only be outlined in this section of the document and they will be referenced by name everywhere else.

> JSON Size Limit → 5MB:
>
> The size limit for the `project.json` file.
> Only applies to online projects, although from testing the desktop editor seems to be unstable with large files.

> Asset Size Limit → 1MB:
> 
> The size limit for each *individual* asset inside of a project.
> (The [wiki](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Project_File_Size) lists no official limit on how many assets a project can contain).

> List Size Limit → 200,000 items:
>
> The maximum number of items a list can hold.

> Variable Size Limit → 10,240 characters:
>
> The maximum amount of characters a given variable **or list entry** can store.

Scratch is also limited by its processing speed largely as a result of it being an interpreted language and most of its rendering functionality being bound to the CPU. This is the most prominant limitation and will be the biggest factor when deciding how projects generated by the compiler should function. 

## The Generated Project

Due to the design goal of decoupling the structure of the language from the structure of the generated project some details of the project will have to be constrained. These constraints will be chosen mainly based on runtime speed, but occasionally based on space efficiency as well.
